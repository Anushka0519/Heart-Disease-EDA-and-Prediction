# Heart-Disease-EDA-and-Prediction
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of heart disease using a publicly available dataset. The objective is to explore the data through visualizations (EDA) and then build a logistic regression model to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes.

The project is built using **Python** in **Google Colab** and covers the entire workflow:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature visualization
- Correlation analysis
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using classification metrics
